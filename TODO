 TODO
======

- Move more rendering logic to the render manager --- the logic is still
  spread all over. The state and logic should be easily readable from one place.
- Task Switcher needs to maintain a list of application windows for
  - the CURRENT_APP_WINDOW property (libmatchbox cannot know current
    application --- focused window is not enough since it can be
    a non-transient dialog box or something temporary [e.g. power menu];
    also, current application might not even want keyboard focus)
  - background killing: non-running (unmapped) applications are visible
    in Task Switcher
  - raising already running (or background killed) applications from
    Task Launcher
  - Close Applications dialog needs to show a list of running applications
  - statistics collection (e.g. most used applications)
  - Application with multiple window stacks is still a single application
- More support for stackable windows:
  - multiple stacks --- is it working now?
  - handle the stack index value (first mapped window might not be the root)
- Implement Close Applications dialog, shown when the user wants to start
  a new application but we don't have enough RAM.
- Implement progress indicator in application window and dialog title.
  Window property _HILDON_WM_WINDOW_PROGRESS_INDICATOR (int), values 0 (off)
  and 1 (on). Other values can be used in future if needed.
- Implement support for speech bubbles in Contacts applets.

hd-transitions:
- reread transitions.ini ONLY IF IT HAS CHANGED
- it's leaking

Notifications:
- Use ATOM:ic property values in hd-note.c.

Switcher:
- When zooming back is complete fade in the real titlebar.
- Scrollbar: place 4 pixels leftwards
- Update label colors with theme change.
- Zoom+fly: don't slow down at the end of zoom and don't start slowly
- Shadowed text in switcher (wishlist).
- Get rid of HdSwitcher, now that there is the render manager

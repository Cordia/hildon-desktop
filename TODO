 TODO
======

- Task Switcher needs to maintain a list of application windows for
  - the CURRENT_APP_WINDOW property (libmatchbox cannot know current
    application --- focused window is not enough since it can be
    a non-transient dialog box or something temporary [e.g. power menu];
    also, current application might not even want keyboard focus)
  - background killing: non-running (unmapped) applications are visible
    in Task Switcher
  - raising already running (or background killed) applications from
    Task Launcher
  - statistics collection (e.g. most used applications)
- More support for stackable windows:
  - multiple stacks --- is it working now?
  - handle the stack index value (first mapped window might not be the root)
- Implement progress indicator in application window and dialog title.
  Window property _HILDON_WM_WINDOW_PROGRESS_INDICATOR (int), values 0 (off)
  and 1 (on). Other values can be used in future if needed.
- Grab the keyboard focus in task switcher view.  Kimmo: What for?
- Make the operator logo disappear in task switcher view.
- Show incoming event notification previews.
- Enter the switcher when an application is closed
  and the switcher is not empty.
- Don't show incoming event notification previews
  if the do not disturb flag is set.
- Remove status area handling from task switcher.
- Be more sensible differentiating clicks vs. scroll attempts.
  (It should be the same usability-wise as pannable areas.)
- Implement portrait mode.
- Implement support for speech bubbles in Contacts applets.
- Add more error checks to matchbox code (e.g. check every CreateWindow)
